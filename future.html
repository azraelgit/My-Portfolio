                <h3>Cyber security</h3>
                <p>
                    I wish to make meaningful contributions to the world through my professional career as an aspiring cyber security professional. I have many prospects including becoming a digital forensics personnel within the Australian Federal Police (AFP), contributing to the resolution of high-profile cases, or a security analyst within the Australian Signals Directorate. Regardless of my position, I want to create a world where privacy is a fundamental right and is protected.

                <h3>Maybe a Lawyer?</h3>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, I have also considered becoming a lawyer. The ability to help people through representing them within the judicial system was something I desired heavily, as I would make a sizable impact on someone’s life. I would specialise in criminal law and defend the defenceless, as cliche as it sounds, and I’m not sure why but something about the courtroom pulls me in. I’ve watched several dramas, most notably Better Call Saul, and it hooked me into the world of law. I can’t express why but the whole process of the legal system attracts me, thus maybe in the future, or in another universe I would become part of it. Okay, it also just looks cool.
