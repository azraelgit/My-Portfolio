                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p> 
                    My life has always been surrounded by technology as I was given a computer at an early age and played too many games to count. I enjoyed playing video games on my computer, Nintendo Wii and DS and was addicted. One of my most memorable moments was when I played Mario Kart Wii immediately after arriving home, for hours on end, racing against computers and hoping to finish 1st in all races and grand prix. Another fond memory was when my dad taught me how to play Starcraft, a real-time strategy (RTS) game at an extremely early age. I was clueless on how to play for hours but was persistent in learning all the concepts.

                    However, Pokemon Platinum was my true <span class="italic">proper</span> game, and to include all the other entries from the franchise (Soul Silver, Black, X, etc), the Pokemon games are probably my most played game of all time. I’m unable to truly express how much this game has shaped me as a person. I Was fascinated by the thrill of catching pokemon, fighting trainers, and exploring the unique world Game Freak has created. For each entry there is a champion to beat and in my first game I was stuck for months trying to beat Cynthia. I would level up my favourite pokemon Luxray to lvl.100 in the hopes to beat Cynthia’s ace, Garchomp, and when I finally did, I was in pure disbelief. I told my parents about my achievement and they were understandably confused but I was proud. Till this day, I challenge myself to reach new heights in either gaming or in real-life. Also here is another picture of me, it really shows how addicted I was to playing games as I was suppose to watch the luggage but instead made it into a chair to play my games on.

                <h3>Extracurricular</h3>
                <p>
                    Well enough about video games, I was also involved in various extracurricular activities, primarily swimming and playing the piano. My mum put me in swimming lessons ever since I was 5 years old, and initially I disliked it as I got tired of racing. Piano was initially a difficult instrument to learn, but I overcame it by practicing every day. Over the years I grew to like both activities and be proud of my accomplishments to the point that I competed against other racers and took part in piano performances in primary school. I also got into tea ball and taekwondo, both nutured my competitiveness. Reflecting now, I'm glad that she made me do these activities as it fostered my competitive nature in a sportsmanlike way, and increased my confidence physically and mentally.
