                <p>
                    I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), studying a Bachelors of Cybersecurity & Criminology. I love all things technology related and have always been fascinated with how far it has progressed within the 21st century. Iâ€™ve grown up observing how technology reshaped society in many positve ways and it has inspired me to take action and be part of this advancement.

                    However, progress does not come without its challenges. Personally, I was affected by the 2022 Optus data breach and it has revealed to me a darker side of the digital landscape. With the rise of data breaches, privacy violations, and artificial intelligence disrupting traditional job markets, it's clear that emerging technologies must be managed with the utmost scrutiny. I believe that through careful management, we can further harness its full potential, whilst mitigating the risks.

                <p>
                    My goal is to leverage my passion for digital technologies into meaningful, positive change to shape a safer, smarter, and more secure future.

                    Setting aside my professional ambitions, I'm also a gamer and enjoy playing various video games including Valorant, Minecraft, Phasmophobia, and many more that would be way too long to list. I also enjoy building computers and keyboards and have built a handful for my friends, totaling hundreds of hours of work. So far I've stuck with minimalistic and compact builds, however I am ready to explore other styles whenever I get the chance.

                    Outside of the digital world, I spend hours experimenting in the kitchen to cook delicious food, following along cooking videos on Youtube to hopefully make it as good as them. One of my proudest culinary achievements is my crispy garlic fried tofu with a side of coconut chilli rice. This took me several months to perfect and I am extremely proud.
                <br><br>
                    I also play the piano every once in a while, performing songs such as Wet Hands by C418 and Final Duet by OMORI, giving Mozart a run for his money! Oh, I also collect <span id="pkmn">too</span> many Pokemon cards, probably my most expensive hobby that I can hopefully tone down in the future. Regardless, I love them and keep my prized cards within a binder.
